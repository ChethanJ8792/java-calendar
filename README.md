#Java Calendar made with the Swing GUI toolkit

Note: For an out-of-the box functionality, appointments could better be stored in for example a JSON-file. This is a school project, for which the use of a database was required. 

## Installation
A SQL-import is required before using the application. See attached SQL-file.
 
## Navigation
Navigation between different monthpanels can be done in two ways:
* Entering a date in the toppanel
* Using the navigation buttons (previous / current / next month)

## Add
An appointment can be added by clicking on "Add" within the desired daypanel.
The fields "Name", "Start time" and "End time" are required. The others are optional.

## Delete / View
To delete an appointment, click on "View" within the desired daypanel. The daydetail-panel on the right will show the appointments of the selected day. Confirm your removal by clicking on "Delete".

## Color descriptions
* Yellow: 0 - 5 appointments
* Orange: 5 - 10 appointments
* Red: > 10 appointments
* Green: current day
* Blue: active day
